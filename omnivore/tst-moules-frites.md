Ingredients Method
1. Tip the mussels into a large
bowl of cold water. Discard any
that remain open when tapped,
then drain well and pull away any
‘beards’. (Fresh mussels look
black and shiny and should only
smell pleasantly of the deep sea
– the vast majority should be
tightly closed. Avoid any that
smell ‘fishy’, look dry or are
mostly open.)
2. Thinly slice the vegetables and
garlic. Roll the chilli in your hands
to loosen the seeds, then slit in
half and shake out the seeds.
Slice the flesh into thin sticks,
then stack together and finely
chop. Pick over the thyme sprigs,
discarding the thick stalks, and
pick the parsley leaves from the
stalks. Prepare the chips (see
recipe, below right).
3. Place a large, heavy-based
sauté pan (with a lid) on the hob

Maris Piper, Kingand heat until you can feel a
strong heat rising. Pour in the oil,
then immediately toss in all of the
vegetables, chilli and thyme. The
thyme sprigs will crackle if the
pan is hot enough. Cook for
about 1½ mins, shaking the pan
and stirring the vegetables until
they start to wilt.
4. With the heat still on high, toss
in all the mussels and shake the
pan so they form an even layer.
Cover with a lid and cook for
another 1-2 mins, shaking the
pan once or twice.
5. Uncover the pan and pour in
the wine and Pernod. Shake and
cook for another 1½ mins so the
wine reduces by half, then cover
again and cook for another min.
Place a large colander over a
bowl and tip the mussels and
vegetables into the centre.
Discard any mussels that remain
closed. Fry the chips.
6. Pour the strained liquid back
in the pan, reheat and stir in the
crème fraîche and whole parsley
leaves. Check the seasoning; you
may not need any salt. Return
the mussels and vegetables to
the pan and reheat, shaking the
pan, then divide between two
large soup bowls. Serve the
chips and mayonnaise (recipe
below) alongside.

prepare the chips before you
start the mussels. Fry the chips

Tip
Fresh mussels
Mussels should feel heavy
for their size. Any that feel
suspiciously light or sound
hollow should be thrown
out. Choose the smallest
mussels you can find, as
these will have the
sweetest flavour and
softest texture.
Tip
Gordon says...
I think some people are
still scared to cook
mussels, but as long as
you buy them really fresh,
there is nothing to fear.after you have cooked the
mussels and while they are still
draining in the colander, then
finish the sauce.
